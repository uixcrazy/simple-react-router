## Explanation Front-end tech stack

> It help you create new project by own.

1. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

    ```
      npx create-react-app simple-react-router
      cd simple-react-router
      npm start
    ```

2. I ejecting all decorators on your create-react-app. There isn’t an easy and clean way to do configs or customize later.

    ```
      npm run eject
    ```

3. Install react-router

  ```npm i react-router react-router-dom```

4. [create simple demo](https://medium.com/@thejasonfile/basic-intro-to-react-router-v4-a08ae1ba5c42)

5.  Code Splitting (I'll create later)
